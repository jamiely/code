description: >
  Jumbly is a word jumble-type game for iOS, written in Objective-C. You
  are given two words. Starting with the first word, you must create a
  new word by changing a single letter, and keep doing so, until you
  arrive at the last word. 


  Jumbly is a port of a previous project in ColdFusion, and uses the same
  word corpus. A seed word is selected randomly and subsequent words
  are selected by searching the corpus with a regular expression derived
  from that seed. Finally, the chain of words between the seed and final 
  word are masked, and the user is presented with the beginning and ending
  words.
