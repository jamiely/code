description: >
  This was a group project in which we took a pre-built motorized cart,
  and hooked its servos to an Arduino board. By adding an Xbee shield to
  the Arduino, we had it wirelessly communicate to a server
  (written in C) hooked to another Arduino and Xbee. We also developed
  an Android application to function as the remote control for the cart.
  The application would send instructions to the server, which would
  send instructions wirelessly to the cart via the Xbees. 


  The project required deep understanding of the stack, ability to 
  develop in several different languages, and debug not only software but
  hardware components.
