title: FlapJS, Quick and Dirty FlappyBird Clone
description: >
  Written when FlappyBird was the top Apple App Store app, this is a 
  bare bones implementation of some of the mechanics.


  It is really spare, having implemented mostly just collision
  generation and detection, simple rendering, and the basic physics
  necessary. Although the code is fairly neat for several hours' work,
  it could do with a generous refactoring and should not be considered
  exemplary code, especially with respect to maintainability.
