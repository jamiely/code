  I was chatting with a co-worker the other day about
  project management, and we mentioned the prevalence of buzzwords.
  Then, we mentioned Buzzword Bingo, and I decided that to implement a
  Bingo application as an iOS app. I looked up Buzzword Bingo in the app
  store and only saw two implementations. I figured I’d write this
  anyway as it’s a simple and well known concept and I need the practice
  anyway.


  The app uses OCUnit for unit tests, Core Data to store
  word lists, and storyboards for layout. A simple server is written using
  the Sinatra light-weight Ruby web framework.
