  Bunny Matcher is a native iOS puzzle game written in Objective-C. 
  Ithas the same concept as the classic game 
  [Super Munchers](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RtRykIE_1A).


  You control a bunny which must match words on a grid to a presented
  topic. For example, if the topic is Planets, you may have to select
  words like Mars, Earth, and Venus. 
  

  Conflict comes in the form of
  non-topic words, which penalize the player by hurting his score, and a
  fox that moves across the board. The player must avoid the fox, as
  touching the fox costs 1 of 3 total lives.
