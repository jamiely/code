  I wanted to illustrate the use
  of monte carlo methods for simple game solving. To make the example
  digestible, I implemented a bare-bones BlackJack game. 
  Each player goes in turn, and may either hit or stay. A
  hint shows at the bottom of the screen that gives advice to the
  player, based on running a monte carlo simulation of the game at that
  point.
