title: Clojure Breakout
description: >
  This is an implementation of the classic game 
  [Breakout](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakout_clone) in Clojure. I 
  used Aquamacs along with clojure-swank for development, and the 
  Leiningen is setup for builds.


  My implementation draws using Javaâ€™s AWT Canvas to render the game
  board. Collision detection is very basic!
