title: Tetris Attack in Clojurescript
description: >
  An implementation of [Tetris
  Attack](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris_Attack), the beloved
  puzzle game in Clojurescript. 


  The game has a treasured place in my heart having provided me with
  hundreds of hours of entertainment. The object of the game is to match
  3 or more blocks.  The complexity of the game comes in setting off
  chain reactions of matches, which throw garbage blocks onto your 
  opponent's screen that he has to clear.
  

  This project gave me a greater sense about how to write more idiomatic
  Clojure, including usage of the thread-first macro, and a good use case
  for multimethods (implementing them in my code is a todo). Additionally,
  this was one of my first completely (almost) functional games, and so 
  was a great stepping stone in helping me to think functionally.
